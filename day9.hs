-- Given the current point, the grid, a stack of points to visit, and a visited set, performs DFS on the grid to find the size of a basin.
-- At a point, we check the 4 directions and add all valid new points to the stack, making sure to add the current point to the visited set.
-- I chose a stack since it was the easiest to write a termination condition for (i.e. I used a dummy value at the bottom of the stack).
-- Note that we only need to check that a point isn't a 9 for it to be valid, not that it's higher than the current point.
-- This is because of the guarantee that all points only belong to 1 basin.
